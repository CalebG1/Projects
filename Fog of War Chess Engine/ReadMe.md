# DarkChess: The first 'Fog of War' chess engine

## Overview
* Fog of War Chess, also known as Dark Chess, is a chess variant of modest popularity where each player's vision is obscured, limiting their view to only the squares reachable by their pieces on the current turn. This comes in stark contrast to the majority of other chess variants that nearly all have engines that play at super-human levels.
* Because the board becomes segmented into a region of known and unknown states, the variation transforms chess from a perfect information to **imperfect information game**. Due to the game tree being intractably large for the majority of game positions as a result of this imperfect information, we investigated using a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to approach Nash equilibrium to prevent exploitable positions.
* The work applies the implementation of a 2022 DeepMind paper titled ``Mastering the Game of Stratego with Model-Free Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning" with key differences in memory structure, algorithmic and architecture alterations, and game-specific heuristic improvements.
