# Minecraft Implementation
Built a first-person and interactive 3D World from scratch (no game engine) using C++ and the OpenGL pipeline. The game implements the key features of Minecraft as is described below in the expandable tabs. This includes a diverse landscape with different biomes and terrains, artificial intelligence in the non-playable characters, inventory/crafting systems, and much more. The final product included over 30 pairs of C++ header and source files as well as over a dozen glsl vertex and fragment shader files with over 10,000 total lines of written code.
